<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage

Depositing Inmate Funds in to an inmates stores/commissary account can be a STRESSFUL and TIME-CONSUMING activity. StoresHere eliminates the driving and traffic problems, finding and paying for parking, waiting in line, and overall stress levels. In other words, let our bonded and insured couriers do all of the work for you. Once weâ€™re notified of your deposit, the inmate funds are physically deposited in the inmates account within 24 hours. Consequently, you will have peace of mind knowing that your inmate can get the resources needed with the funding you provided.
